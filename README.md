The project is a hotel reservation web app that allows users to search for hotels in India using specific search criteria. The app can detect a user's current location and display nearby hotels. Additionally, users can search for hotels by specific dates or location in India. The app allows users to see details of a specific hotel, including price, images, location, and description.

To use the app, users need to enter the name of the city they want to search for, select check-in and check-out dates, and indicate the number of people and rooms needed. Once the search button is clicked, the app will redirect the user to a page displaying all the hotels available in the chosen location. By clicking on the "see availability" button, users can access details about a specific hotel, including its price, location, address, and images. If a user decides to book a hotel, they can click the "reserve now" button, which will open a modal with available rooms and room descriptions, including room numbers. After confirming the details, users can click the "book now" button, and their booking will be completed. If a user needs to cancel their booking, they can do so by going to the user bookings page and canceling from there.

The project includes an Admin Panel that can be accessed by logging in using the provided credentials (email: badmin70@gmail.com, password: badmin7067). The home page displays a graph showing the user count for the previous six months. The panel also allows users to view, create, and delete users, hotels, and rooms.

To create a hotel detail, users need to click on the "add new" button on the hotel page, which will redirect them to an "add hotel" page. On this page, users need to upload six images that will appear on the page instantly, fill in all necessary information related to the hotel, and select the hotel room they want to add. After clicking the "upload" button, the images will be uploaded to Firebase, and the progress bar will display the percentage of images uploaded. Once all images are uploaded, users can click the "create hotel" button to create a hotel detail in the database. All fields will be cleared for the next hotel creation.

To create a room detail, users need to go to the room page and click on the "add new room" button, which will redirect them to an "add room" page. Here, users need to fill in all details related to the room, including room numbers, and select the hotel to attach the room to. After filling in all necessary details, users can click the "create" button to create a room in the database.
